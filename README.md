Play SetWithFriends automatically.

Join a game at [setwithfriends.com](https://setwithfriends.com/) and right click to open developer tools on Chrome. Click on the "Console" tab and paste the whole file into the JavaScript interpreter and click enter.

The script will stop once the game ends. To restart the script when the game restarts, type "loop();" into the interpreter and hit enter.

Mess with the random timeout on line 97 to adjust how fast the script plays. By default, it waits between 2 and 6 seconds between making moves with mean 4.
